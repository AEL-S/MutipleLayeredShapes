# MutipleLayeredShapes

<h3>Shapes Exercise</h3>

After learning how to make a basic ball shape, this exercise expanded on that. I learned to layer shapes of different colors, dimensions, and at different z positions. There was no direction on what size or colors to make the balls, so I matched it as best I could at the time by sight. I intend to re-do this assignment eventually to ultimately match the example 100%.

<h5>Colors used in my version of the exercise:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>#a52a2a</li>
  <li>#daa520</li>
  <li>#adff2f</li>
  <li>#add8e6</li>
  <li>#808080</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br>
  
  <h5>Z-index used:</h5>
  5; 10 - depending on the ball.
  
<h5>Example of what completed assignment should look like:</h5>
