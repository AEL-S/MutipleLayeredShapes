# MutipleLayeredShapes

<h4>Shapes Exercise</h4>

After learning how to make a ball shape, this exercise expanded on that. I learned to layer shapes of different colors, dimensions, and at different z positions. There was no direction on what size or colors to make the balls, so I had to match it as best I could by sight.

<h5>Colors used in my version of the exercise:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>#a52a2a</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  </ul>
